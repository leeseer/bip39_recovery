🌟 Bitcoin Mnemonic Recovery Tool

A powerful Rust-based tool for recovering Bitcoin wallet addresses by generating and testing BIP-39 mnemonic phrases. 🚀 It supports parallel processing, progress tracking, and robust error handling, making it ideal for recovering lost wallet seeds efficiently.
✨ Features

Mnemonic Generation: Generates BIP-39 mnemonic phrases with fixed and permutable words.
Address Support: Supports P2WPKH, P2PKH, and P2SH-P2WPKH address types.
Flexible Input: Match against a single address, a file with an address, or a database of addresses.
Customizable: Configurable derivation paths and Bitcoin network (mainnet/testnet).
Parallel Processing: Leverages rayon for high-performance permutation testing.
Progress Tracking: Displays a progress bar with speed and ETA, and saves progress to resume after interruptions.
Logging: Detailed file-based logging with debug mode for troubleshooting.
Graceful Exit: Saves progress on Ctrl+C for seamless recovery.

🛠️ Prerequisites
To run this tool, ensure you have:

Rust: Stable toolchain (install via rustup).
System Dependencies:
libssl-dev and pkg-config for cryptographic operations.
curl for downloading the BIP-39 wordlist.


BIP-39 Wordlist: bip39_wordlist.txt (downloaded automatically by the installer).

🚀 Installation

Clone the Repository:
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name


Run the Installer Script:
chmod +x installer.sh
./installer.sh

The script handles everything:

Installs system dependencies (build-essential, libssl-dev, pkg-config, curl).
Sets up Rust if not installed.
Downloads the BIP-39 wordlist (bip39_wordlist.txt).
Builds the project with cargo build --release.



📖 Usage
Run the tool with:
cargo run --release -- [options]

View all options with:
cargo run --release -- --help

File containing a single address
-


--address-db-file <FILE>
File with a list of addresses (one per line)
-


--total-words <NUMBER>
Total words in the mnemonic (e.g., 12, 24)
-


--fixed-words <NUMBER>
Number of fixed words (prefix)
-


--known-words <WORDS>
Comma-separated known words
-


--seed-words-file <FILE>
File with known words (one per line)
-


--path <PATH>
BIP-32 derivation path
m/44'/0'/0'/0/0


--batch-size <NUMBER>
Save progress every N permutations
10000


--gpu
Enable GPU acceleration (not implemented)
false


--network <NETWORK>
Bitcoin network (mainnet or testnet)
mainnet


--address-type <TYPE>
Address type (p2wpkh, p2pkh, p2sh-p2wpkh)
p2wpkh


--debug
Enable debug logging
false


--log-file <FILE>
Log file path
recovery.log


--progress-file <FILE>
Progress file path
progress.txt


Example
Recover a 12-word mnemonic with 6 fixed words:
cargo run --release -- --address 1A1zP1eP5QGefi2DMPTfTL5SLmv7DivfNa --total-words 12 --fixed-words 6 --known-words weekend,abandon,ability,able,about,above,absent,absorb,abstract,absurd,abuse,access --network mainnet --address-type p2wpkh

Output

Progress Bar: Shows permutations processed, speed (hashes/sec), and ETA.
Logs: Written to recovery.log (or specified file) with debug details if enabled.
Progress Saving: Saved to progress.txt (or specified file) every batch-size permutations.
Match Found: Prints the mnemonic and address, then exits.
Interruption: Ctrl+C saves progress before exiting.

📦 Dependencies
Managed by Cargo:

bitcoin: Address generation and BIP-32 derivation.
bip39: Mnemonic validation and seed generation.
clap: Command-line argument parsing.
anyhow: Robust error handling.
rayon: Parallel processing for permutations.
patricia_tree: Efficient BIP-39 wordlist lookups.
indicatif: Progress bar visualization.
simplelog: File-based logging.
itertools: Permutation generation.
ctrlc: Graceful Ctrl+C handling.
secp256k1: Cryptographic operations.

📝 Notes

The BIP-39 wordlist (bip39_wordlist.txt) is required in the project root and is downloaded by the installer.
Parallel processing is enabled for permutation counts ≥ 1000, using 12 threads by default.
Progress is saved periodically to resume from the last checkpoint.
Debug mode (--debug) provides detailed logs for troubleshooting.
GPU support is not implemented in this version.
